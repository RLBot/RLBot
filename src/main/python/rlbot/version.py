# 2) we can import it in setup.py for the same reason

    '1.0.0': """
    Time for the big 1.0.0 release! We actually left "beta" a long time ago so this isn't as big
    a milestone as the number implies, but we DO have two great new features!

    1. Setting game state. You can manipulate the position, velocity, etc of the ball and the cars!
    This can be a great help during bot development, and you can also get creative with it. Visit
    the wiki for details and documentation - https://github.com/RLBot/RLBot/wiki/Manipulating-Game-State
    Code written by hallo_doei, ccman32, and tarehart

    2. Ball prediction. We now provide a list of future ball positions based on chip's excellent
    physics modeling. Take advantage of this to do next-level wall reads, catches, and dribbles! You can
    read about the math involved here: https://samuelpmish.github.io/notes/RocketLeague/ball_bouncing/
    Note: currently the wall bounces are only accurate on the standard arena, not hoops or dropshot.
    Documentation and examples can be found here: https://github.com/RLBot/RLBot/wiki/Ball-Path-Prediction
    Code written by chip and tarehart

    Bonus: You can now play on Salty Shores thanks to hallo_doei
