    '1.4.2': """
    Adding support for auto-running java bots during tournaments. To take advantage of this
    in your bot, see https://github.com/RLBot/RLBotJavaExample/wiki/Auto-Launching-Java
    
    Plus bug fixes:
    - Fixed a bug where auto-run executables would crash when trying to write to stderr.
    - Dragging bots to another team in the GUI no longer breaks the config.

    '1.3.0': """
    Accurate ball prediction for Hoops and Dropshot modes!
      - Kipje13, Marvin, NeverCast, et. al.
    """,
    '1.2.6': """
    Fixed a bug where field info was not extracted properly during dropshot mode.
    It was reporting 2 goals rather than the expected 140.
    """,
    '1.2.5': """
    ***************************************************
    *  Fix for dodge cancels / half flips! - ccman32  *
    ***************************************************
    
    Plus:
    - Changing the rendering strategy for 3D lines that go past the camera. Formerly it was
      "draw it, even though it's crazy sometimes", now it will be "don't draw it".
    - Showing the rate that inputs are received for each player index when you press the
      [home] key. Toggle back off with the [end] key.
    - Fixed a bug where party_member_bot could get influenced by real controller input.
    - Creating new presets in the GUI works better now.
    - Got rid of the libpng warning seen when using the GUI.
    - Giving specific error messages when cfg files are messed up.
    """,
    '1.2.2': """
    - Rearranged the GUI a bit, and made it load and track appearance configs more effectively.
    - Fixed bug where RUN button behavior in the GUI would not work after killing bots.
    """,
    '1.2.0': """
    - We now offer a 'RigidBodyTick' thanks to whatisaphone! It's a lower-level representation of
    physics data which updates at 120Hz and is not subject to interpolation. You can still make a 
    great bot without it, but this feature is quite nice for the scientists among us.
    
    See https://github.com/RLBot/RLBotPythonExample/wiki/Rigid-Body-Tick for more details!

    - Faster way to access ball prediction data in python. - Skyborg
    - Java bots will now shut down when the python framework quits. This has been necessary recently
    to avoid buggy situations.
    - Shutting down the python framework will no longer attempt to kill bots twice in a row.
    - Clicking on the "Run" button twice in a row in the GUI will no longer spawn duplicate processes.

    You can now get information about the ball's status in Dropshot mode thanks to hallo_doei!

    Other changes:
    - The loadout config for orange team is now respected again. - ccman32
    - Fixed a bug where the GUI would crash with a "KeyError". - hallo_doei
    - Avoiding and suppressing some game crashes, and also restoring the
      ability to get game tick data during replays and the postgame. - tarehart

    The latest Rocket League patch broke dodges for our bots; this update fixes it.

    Maximum size for a render message has been decreased again because many people experienced
    errors related to memory access. The limit is now only double the original.
    """,
    '1.0.4': """
    - Maximum size for a render message has been increased by a factor of 100. This means you can
      draw a lot of lines at once without getting errors.
    - Boost amount for cars will now round up to the nearest integer, so 0.3% boost will now appear
      as 1 instead of 0.
    - Fixed a crash that would commonly happen after a match ends. As a side effect, you can no longer
      see up-to-date player data during instant replays.

    '1.0.3': """
    Time for the big 1.0 release! We actually left "beta" a long time ago so this isn't as big
    a milestone as the number implies, but we DO have two great new features!

    1. Setting game state. You can manipulate the position, velocity, etc of the ball and the cars!
    This can be a great help during bot development, and you can also get creative with it. Visit
    the wiki for details and documentation - https://github.com/RLBot/RLBot/wiki/Manipulating-Game-State
    Code written by hallo_doei, ccman32, and tarehart

    2. Ball prediction. We now provide a list of future ball positions based on chip's excellent
    physics modeling. Take advantage of this to do next-level wall reads, catches, and dribbles! You can
    read about the math involved here: https://samuelpmish.github.io/notes/RocketLeague/ball_bouncing/
    Note: currently the wall bounces are only accurate on the standard arena, not hoops or dropshot.
    Documentation and examples can be found here: https://github.com/RLBot/RLBot/wiki/Ball-Path-Prediction
    Code written by chip and tarehart

    Bonus:
     - You can now play on Salty Shores thanks to hallo_doei
     - Bug fix for people with spaces in their file path by Zaptive
     - Subprocess agent for future Rust support by whatisaphone
