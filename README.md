### Short Description
The RLBot framework helps people create bots for use in Rocket League's offline modes, just for fun.
It provides values from the game like car and ball position, and carries back button presses.
RLBot works for up to 10 bots.

If you just want to make a bot, you don't need to be here. Instead, just start with one of these:
 - Python - https://github.com/RLBot/RLBotPythonExample
 - Java - https://github.com/RLBot/RLBotJavaExample

If you want to make improvements that help out everyone, you're in the right place!
