## Bot Makers Read This!

***If you just want to make a bot, you don't need to be here. Instead, start with one of these:***
 - Python - https://github.com/RLBot/RLBotPythonExample
 - Java - https://github.com/RLBot/RLBotJavaExample
 - .NET (C#, VB.NET, F# and other CLI languages) - https://github.com/RLBot/RLBotCSharpExample

But if you want to make improvements that help out everyone, you're in the right place!

## Framework Info

The RLBot framework helps people create bots for use in Rocket League's offline modes, just for fun.
It provides values from the game like car and ball position, and carries back button presses.
RLBot works for up to 10 bots.

### Requirements
Windows, Rocket League, Python 3.6.

### Quick Start

1. Double-click on setup.bat
2. Open up Rocket League
4. Open a terminal and execute `python runner.py`

### Development Workflow

The first thing you'll want to do is run `setup.bat`. This does a lot of important things:
- Sets up your rlbot installation in pip to link to your local files in this folder. Once you've done this,
running rlbot from *anywhere* on your computer will reference these local files, including the dlls, etc.
- Generates important code based on the `.fbs` message spec. Therefore it's a prerequisite for running anything.
- Installs python package dependencies.

If you're doing work that affects our `.dll` or `.exe` files, you should also be aware of:
- `copy-dlls.bat` - This copies *the debug versions* any built dlls from visual studio into the correct subdirectory in
the python source folder.
- `copy-dlls-release.bat` - This copies *the release versions* any built dlls from visual studio into the correct subdirectory in
the python source folder.

For deploying changes, please see https://github.com/RLBot/RLBot/wiki/Deploying-Changes

When you're done with development and want to get back to the official rlbot version vended from
https://pypi.org/project/rlbot/, the easiest way to do that is simply `pip uninstall rlbot`. Then
the next time you execute a bat file from one of the RLBot*Example repos, a fresh copy will be
installed from pip.
