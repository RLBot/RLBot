### Short Description
The RLBot framework helps people create bots for use in Rocket League's offline modes, just for fun.
It provides values from the game like car and ball position, and carries back button presses.
RLBot works for up to 10 bots.

If you just want to make a bot, you don't need to be here. Instead, just start with one of these:
 - Python - https://github.com/RLBot/RLBotPythonExample
 - Java - https://github.com/RLBot/RLBotJavaExample

If you want to make improvements that help out everyone, you're in the right place!

### Requirements
Windows, Rocket League, Python 3.6, Java 1.8, Gradle.

### Quick Start

1. Double-click on setup.bat
2. Open up Rocket League
3. Open a terminal and execute `python runner.py`

### Gradle Commands
gradle build - The main gradle command. This does the majority of the building, compiling, and setting up the code to run. Should be called after any protocol change.
gradle copyDlls - This copies any built dlls from visual studio into the correct folder to speed up compile -> run time.
