### Short Description
RLBot is a framework to create bots to play Rocket League that reads values from the game and outputs button presses to the game. RLBot works for up to 10 bots.

#### ToDo
- General bug fixes as they come up

### Requirements
Windows, Rocket League, Python 3. If you are running my tensorflow bot than you definitley need (Python 3.5, Google Tensorflow).

### Longer Description

#### Good Information
 - Start with the [Setup guide](https://github.com/RLBot/RLBot/wiki/Setup-Instructions-%28current%29). When you're done, there are [more wikis](https://github.com/RLBot/RLBot/wiki) with additional information.
 - We have a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/zbaAKPt) (the heart of the community, please join!)
 - [We also have a subreddit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeagueBots/)
