## Bot Makers Read This!

***If you just want to make a bot, you don't need to be here. Instead, start with one of these:***
 - Python - https://github.com/RLBot/RLBotPythonExample
 - Java - https://github.com/RLBot/RLBotJavaExample

But if you want to make improvements that help out everyone, you're in the right place!

## Framework Info

The RLBot framework helps people create bots for use in Rocket League's offline modes, just for fun.
It provides values from the game like car and ball position, and carries back button presses.
RLBot works for up to 10 bots.

### Requirements
Windows, Rocket League, Python 3.6.

### Quick Start

1. Double-click on setup.bat
2. Run `pip install -r .\src\main\python\requirements.txt`
(may be slightly different for you if you don't have pip on your PATH)
3. Open up Rocket League
4. Open a terminal and execute `python runner.py`

### Useful Scripts

- `setup.bat` - This generates some code from our message spec, and also installs python package dependencies.
- `copy-dlls.bat` - This copies any built dlls from visual studio into the correct folder to speed up compile -> run time.

#### Gradle

Gradle is a build / dependency management system. You can execute various tasks with `gradlew.bat some_task`.
To use gradle, you'll need to install JDK 8 or higher.


- `publishToPyPI` - Uploads our package to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/rlbot/).
This is done when we want to make an update available to bot makers.
To run this successfully, you will need to create a [.pypirc](https://docs.python.org/3.6/distutils/packageindex.html#pypirc) file.
Ask somebody for the username and password.
- `build` - Generates and builds Java code.
- `bintrayUpload` - Uploads Java artifacts to
[bintray](https://bintray.com/rlbotofficial/RLBotMaven/rlbot-framework). This is done when we're ready to
make an update available to java bots. To run this successfully, you will need to create a local.properties file.
  See the build.gradle file for details.
